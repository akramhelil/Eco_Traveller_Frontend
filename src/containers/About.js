    A sector of tourism, ecotourism is travel to natural areas that provide environmental, cultural and economic benefits to local communities and host countries. It’s about harmoniously interacting with the local people, customs, languages and ecosystems and improving the welfare of the local community.

    Ecotourism is the fastest growing market in the tourism industry and continues to flourish, according to the World Tourism Organization. At an annual growth rate of 5 percent, it accounts for 11.4 percent of global consumer spending.

Eco-tourist destinations are places where visitors can immerse themselves in the local culture while respecting nature and the geographic area’s local traditions.</h4>
